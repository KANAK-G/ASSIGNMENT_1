    "### 1. What is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.**Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.Human learning starts at birth (it might even start before) and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between people and their environment.\n",
    "e.g learning of bird-concept from the given examples of birds (positive examples) and non-birds (negative examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.**Supervised learning is similar to concept learning (Bruner & Austin, 1986), where a person is required to classify new objects into existing categories, by matching the features of the new objects to examples in the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks follow the neuronal principle of Hebbian learning, where the algorithm centres on inputs with similar properties, just like how neurons that activate simultaneously strengthen the synaptic link between each other (Sanger, 1989).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is machine learning, and how does it work? What are the key responsibilities of machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.**Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.The key responsibilities are -\n",
    "Designing ML systems.\n",
    "Researching and implementing ML algorithms and tools.\n",
    "Selecting appropriate data sets.\n",
    "Picking appropriate data representation methods.\n",
    "Identifying differences in data distribution that affects model performance.\n",
    "Verifying data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Define the terms penalty & reward in the context of reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.**In reinforcement learning, we train ML models by using rewards and punishments. Whenever our machine takes a correct decision we reward a point and in wrong decisions we penalty a point. From these responses, our model learns how to react in that particular situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Explain the term learning as a search?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.** Concept learning can be viewed as the task of searching through a large space of hypotheses implicitly defined by the hypothesis representation. • The goal of this search is to find the hypothesis that best fits the training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What are the various goals of machine learning? What is the relationship between these and human learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.**The purpose of machine learning is to discover patterns in your data and then make predictions based on often complex patterns to answer business questions, detect and analyse trends and help solve problems.\n",
    "Humans acquire knowledge through experience either directly or shared by others. Machines acquire knowledge through experience shared in the form of past data. We have the terms, Knowledge, Skill, and Memory being used to define intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Illustrate the various elements of machine learning using a real-life illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.1. Image recognition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Image recognition is a well-known and widespread example of machine learning in the real world. It can identify an object as a digital image, based on the intensity of the pixels in black and white images or colour images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label an x-ray as cancerous or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign a name to a photographed face (aka “tagging” on social media)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognise handwriting by segmenting a single letter into smaller images\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Speech recognition**\n",
    "Machine learning can translate speech into text. Certain software applications can convert live voice and recorded speech into a text file. The speech can be segmented by intensities on time-frequency bands as well.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Real-world examples of speech recognition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Voice search\n",
    "Voice dialling\n",
    "Appliance control\n",
    "Some of the most common uses of speech recognition software are devices like Google Home or Amazon Alexa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Medical diagnosis**\n",
    "Machine learning can help with the diagnosis of diseases. Many physicians use chatbots with speech recognition capabilities to discern patterns in symptoms.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Real-world examples for medical diagnosis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assisting in formulating a diagnosis or recommends a treatment option\n",
    "Oncology and pathology use machine learning to recognise cancerous tissue \n",
    "Analyse bodily fluids\n",
    "In the case of rare diseases, the joint use of facial recognition software and machine learning helps scan patient photos and identify phenotypes that correlate with rare genetic diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Provide an example of the abstraction method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.**Making coffee with a coffee machine is a good example of abstraction. You need to know how to use your coffee machine to make coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is the concept of generalization? What function does it play in the machine learning process?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.**In machine learning, generalization is a definition to demonstrate how well is a trained model to classify or forecast unseen data.\n",
    "    A model's ability to generalize is central to the success of a model. If a model has been trained too well on training data, it will be unable to generalize. It will make inaccurate predictions when given new data, making the model useless even though it is able to make accurate predictions for the training data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 10.What is classification, exactly? What are the main distinctions between classification and regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes.\n",
    "    The main difference between Regression and Classification algorithms that Regression algorithms are used to predict the continuous values such as price, salary, age, etc. and Classification algorithms are used to predict/Classify the discrete values such as Male or Female, True or False, Spam or Not Spam, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 11. What is regression, and how does it work? Give an example of a real-world problem that was solved using regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.**Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables.The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y). It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Describe the clustering mechanism in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.**Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.\n",
    "eg.Customers segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. Make brief observations on two of the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ii. Studying under supervision:** Supervised learning allows you to collect data or produce a data output from the previous experience.Under supervision we predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "**iii. Studying without supervision:** Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model.Without supervision we cannot make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Machine learning algorithms are used\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Reinforcement learning is a form of learning based on positive reinforcement."
